// To give luzlifter functionality
// 1. include luzlifter object into scene.
// 2. include powerconnection box into scene.
// 3. create a new c# script titled Lifter + level + phase + item number with underscore in between.
//  for example if I were adding a lifter to level 1 phase 3 and it was the second lifter, 
//  my script name would be Lifter_01_03_2
//  3a. 
// 4. add script to lifter item
// 5. create enw c# script titled Powerconnection_Lifter (and then the same level phase and item numbers)
